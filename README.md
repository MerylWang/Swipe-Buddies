## Mac N' Cheese

## Purpose

The purpose of the application is to provide MIT students with free meals. A lot of meals go wasted, so students can donate their meal swipes to the website and recieve swipes as well. Currently our app allows users to define their schedule through a when-2-meet type of timeslot and choose times that work well. If a student is matched, they are notified through an email to meet up.
